# kf1_mods_installer

# What does this do?
It easily installs killing floor 1 workshop mods in mass amounts via workshop collections.\
This was mainly created because the kf1 workshop breaks after you subscribe to more than 50 items.\
It also installs all mods in the game directory, in their own Mods folder, keeping the game install cleaner

# Using:
1) run game atleast once
2) set information in settings.json
3) run bat
4) run game
